# StoreKit Integration Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the StoreKit integration in the app to enhance robustness, testability, and reliability.

## 1. Transaction Queue Implementation

A robust transaction queue has been implemented to ensure purchase transactions are properly tracked and completed, even if they are interrupted during the process.

### Key Features:

- **Persistent Transaction Queue**: Transactions are stored persistently and can survive app restarts
- **Automatic Retry Mechanism**: Failed transactions are automatically retried up to 5 times
- **Cleanup System**: Completed transactions older than 24 hours are automatically removed
- **Network Awareness**: Transactions only attempt to process when network connectivity is available
- **Transaction Status Tracking**: Each transaction has a status (pending, processing, completed, failed, retrying)

### Usage:

The queue operates automatically in the background once a purchase is initiated. When a purchase fails due to a network error or is interrupted, it is automatically added to the queue for later processing.

```dart
// Transactions are added to the queue automatically when a purchase fails
try {
  await revenueCatService.purchaseProduct(productId);
} catch (e) {
  // The transaction is automatically added to the queue for retry
  // No additional code is needed
}
```

## 2. Enhanced Sandbox Testing Support

A dedicated sandbox testing system has been implemented to improve debugging and testing of StoreKit integrations in the sandbox environment.

### Key Features:

- **Detailed Logging**: Captures detailed logs of all steps in the purchase process
- **Log Visualization**: View logs directly in the app for easy debugging
- **Test Modes**: Toggle sandbox testing on/off easily
- **Configurable Log Levels**: Set different verbosity levels for logs
- **Transaction Record**: Logs all transaction details before and after purchase attempts

### Usage:

```dart
// Show the sandbox testing UI
await SandboxTestingHelper.showSandboxTestingUI(context);

// Simulate a sandbox purchase with detailed logging
await SandboxTestingHelper.simulateSandboxPurchase(
  context,
  revenueCatService,
  RevenueCatProductIds.monthlyId
);

// View sandbox logs
await SandboxTestingHelper.showSandboxLogs(context);
```

## 3. Robust Payment Sheet Presentation

A new system has been implemented to improve the reliability of payment sheet presentation, with proper error handling for cases where the payment sheet fails to appear.

### Key Features:

- **Timeout Detection**: Detects when payment sheets fail to appear after a timeout
- **User Feedback**: Provides clear error messages to users when issues occur
- **Status Tracking**: Tracks the full lifecycle of payment sheet presentation
- **Network Validation**: Validates network connectivity before attempting to show payment sheets
- **Platform-Specific Handling**: Handles iOS and Android payment sheets differently as needed

### Usage:

```dart
// Present a payment sheet with robust error handling
final result = await PaymentSheetHandler.presentPaymentSheet(
  context: context,
  package: package,
);

// Handle the result
switch (result) {
  case PaymentSheetStatus.completedSuccessfully:
    // Handle successful purchase
    break;
  case PaymentSheetStatus.userCancelled:
    // Handle user cancellation
    break;
  case PaymentSheetStatus.failedToPresent:
    // Handle failure to present the payment sheet
    break;
  case PaymentSheetStatus.error:
    // Handle other errors
    break;
  default:
    // Handle other cases
    break;
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:

- `lib/services/revenue_cat_service.dart` - Added transaction queue system
- `lib/services/payment_sheet_handler.dart` - Added robust payment sheet handling
- `lib/screens/premium/testing/sandbox_testing_helper.dart` - Added sandbox testing support

### Testing:

Unit tests have been added for these new components:

- `test/services/payment_sheet_handler_test.dart` - Tests for payment sheet handling

### Dependencies:

No new dependencies were added, as the implementation uses the existing packages:

- `connectivity_plus` - For network connectivity detection
- `path_provider` - For log file storage
- `shared_preferences` - For persisting transaction queue

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive analytics for purchase flow failures
- Implement A/B testing for different error message presentations
- Create a visual transaction history view for debugging
