# Confetti Animation and Success Modal Tests

This document provides an overview of the automated tests implemented for the confetti animation and success modal functionality in the Pomo Timer app.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized into several files:

1. **`test/animations/confetti_animation_test.dart`**: Unit tests for the `ConfettiAnimation` class.
2. **`test/screens/premium_success_modal_test.dart`**: Widget tests for the `PremiumSuccessModal` component.
3. **`test/animations/purchase_success_handler_test.dart`**: Tests for the `PurchaseSuccessHandler` utility class.
4. **`test/integration/purchase_flow_test.dart`**: Integration tests for the entire purchase flow.

## Test Cases

### 1. Confetti Trigger Tests

These tests verify that the confetti animation triggers correctly on successful purchases:

- **Monthly Subscription**: Tests that the confetti animation appears with the correct intensity for monthly subscriptions.
- **Yearly Subscription**: Tests that the confetti animation appears with the correct intensity for yearly subscriptions.
- **Lifetime Subscription**: Tests that the confetti animation appears with the correct intensity (highest) for lifetime subscriptions.

### 2. Modal Display Tests

These tests ensure that the success modal appears after the confetti animation:

- **Modal Appearance**: Verifies that the modal appears with the correct title and content.
- **Animation Sequence**: Checks that the modal fades in after the confetti animation starts.
- **Subscription-Specific Content**: Confirms that the modal displays different messages based on the subscription type.

### 3. Dismissal Tests

These tests confirm that the modal closes correctly:

- **Tap Outside**: Verifies that the modal closes when tapping outside it.
- **Button Press**: Confirms that the modal closes when pressing the "Start Using Premium" button.

### 4. Navigation Tests

These tests verify the navigation flow after interacting with the modal:

- **Home Screen Redirect**: Checks that the user is redirected to the Home Screen after dismissing the modal.

### 5. Failure Handling Tests

These tests ensure that no confetti animation or modal appears for failed purchases:

- **Error Status**: Verifies that no animation or modal appears when the purchase status is set to error.

### 6. Edge Case Tests

These tests handle app interruptions during the purchase flow:

- **App Restart**: Simulates an app restart during the purchase process and verifies that the flow continues correctly.

## Running the Tests

To run all the tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
flutter test test/animations/confetti_animation_test.dart
flutter test test/screens/premium_success_modal_test.dart
flutter test test/animations/purchase_success_handler_test.dart
flutter test test/integration/purchase_flow_test.dart
```

## Test Implementation Details

### Mocking and Dependencies

- **SharedPreferences**: Mocked using `SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues({})`.
- **Navigator**: Used a `GlobalKey<NavigatorState>` to access the navigator from the tests.
- **Providers**: Used `ChangeNotifierProvider.value()` to provide test instances of services.

### Testing Animations

Since animations are asynchronous, the tests use:

- `tester.pumpAndSettle()`: To wait for animations to complete.
- `tester.pump(duration)`: To advance the animation by a specific duration.

### Testing User Interactions

- `tester.tap(finder)`: To simulate tapping on widgets.
- `tester.tapAt(offset)`: To simulate tapping at specific coordinates.

## Conclusion

These tests provide comprehensive coverage of the confetti animation and success modal functionality, ensuring that:

1. The animation triggers correctly for different subscription types.
2. The modal appears with the correct content.
3. The modal can be dismissed in multiple ways.
4. The navigation flow works as expected.
5. Failed purchases are handled correctly.
6. The app handles interruptions gracefully.

This test suite follows best practices for widget testing in Flutter, with stable, concise tests that cover real-world scenarios.
