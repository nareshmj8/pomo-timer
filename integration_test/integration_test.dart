    These tests are designed to be run individually, not all together.
    Running them together causes issues with singletons and Flutter bindings.
    
    Please run each test file individually with commands like:
    
    flutter test integration_test/timer_flow_test.dart
    flutter test integration_test/subscription_flow_test.dart
    flutter test integration_test/task_management_test.dart
    flutter test integration_test/notification_test.dart
    
    If you need to generate coverage reports, run each test with the --coverage flag
    and merge the results.
    
    For more information, see the README.md file in the integration_test directory.
    =====================================================================
