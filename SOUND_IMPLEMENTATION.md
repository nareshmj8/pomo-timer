# Native iOS Sound Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of native iOS system notification sounds in the Pomodoro Timer app.

## Overview

The app now uses native iOS system notification sounds for various events:
- Timer completion
- Break completion
- Long break completion
- Subscription expiry alerts

## Implementation Details

### 1. Sound Files

The following sound files have been added to the iOS project:
- `complete.caf` - Played when a timer session completes
- `break_complete.caf` - Played when a break session completes
- `long_break_complete.caf` - Played when a long break session completes
- `subscription_alert.caf` - Played for subscription-related notifications

These files are located in the `ios/Runner/Resources` directory and are included in the Xcode project build.

### 2. Notification Service

The `NotificationService` class has been enhanced to handle different notification sounds:

- `playTimerCompletionSound()` - Plays a sound when a timer session completes
- `playBreakCompletionSound()` - Plays a sound when a break session completes
- `playLongBreakCompletionSound()` - Plays a sound when a long break session completes

Each method creates a notification with a specific sound file and message.

### 3. Integration with Settings Provider

The `SettingsProvider` class has been updated to use the `NotificationService` for playing sounds:

- The `SoundService` has been removed
- Sound playback is now handled by the `NotificationService`
- The sound setting is still respected (sounds are only played if enabled)

### 4. Dependencies

- Removed the `audioplayers` dependency from `pubspec.yaml`
- Removed the sound asset from the Flutter assets

## App Store Compliance

This implementation ensures compliance with App Store policies by:

1. Using only native iOS system sounds
2. Providing appropriate notification messages
3. Respecting user notification preferences
4. Using the official Flutter Local Notifications package

## Testing

To test the sound implementation:
1. Run the app on an iOS device
2. Start a timer session
3. Wait for the timer to complete
4. Verify that the appropriate notification sound is played
5. Repeat for break sessions and long break sessions

## Troubleshooting

If sounds are not playing:
1. Check that notifications are enabled in iOS settings
2. Verify that the sound setting is enabled in the app
3. Ensure the device is not in silent mode
4. Check that the sound files are correctly included in the Xcode project
