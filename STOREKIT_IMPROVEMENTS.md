# StoreKit Implementation Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to our app's StoreKit implementation to enhance the purchase flow, improve sandbox testing capabilities, and ensure better reliability during network interruptions.

## 1. Transaction Queue Implementation

We've implemented a robust transaction storage and queuing system that ensures purchases are preserved even when network conditions are poor. Key features include:

- **Transaction Storage**: All purchase attempts are safely stored and can be retried automatically.
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Failed transactions are automatically retried with exponential backoff.
- **Network Awareness**: The app detects network conditions and handles interrupted purchases gracefully.
- **Manual Queue Processing**: Users can force-process pending transactions from the settings screen.
- **Transaction Monitoring**: A detailed UI for monitoring the transaction queue status.

## 2. Enhanced Sandbox Testing Support

We've improved the sandbox testing experience with:

- **Transaction Queue Visibility**: Developers can see all pending transactions during testing.
- **Force Processing**: Manually trigger processing of the transaction queue for testing edge cases.
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of StoreKit interactions for debugging.

## 3. Robust Payment Sheet Presentation

We've created a specialized `PaymentSheetHandler` to resolve common issues with payment sheets:

- **Payment Sheet Timeout Detection**: Identifies when payment sheets fail to appear and provides user feedback.
- **Failure Recovery**: Automatically queues purchase attempts that fail due to network or sheet presentation issues.
- **User-friendly Error Messages**: Clear feedback when issues occur with payment sheets.

## 4. UI Integration

We've integrated these improvements into the user experience:

- **RobustPurchaseButton**: A drop-in replacement for standard purchase buttons that leverages all the robustness improvements.
- **Purchase Safety Section**: User-facing tools in settings for handling purchase issues.
- **Transaction Status Indicators**: Clear indicators of transaction status in the UI.

## How to Use

### Using the RobustPurchaseButton

```dart
RobustPurchaseButton(
  productId: RevenueCatProductIds.monthlyId,
  label: 'Subscribe Monthly',
  icon: Icons.star,
  onPurchaseCompleted: () {
    // Handle successful purchase
  },
)
```

### Monitoring Transaction Queue

Use the PurchaseSafetySection in settings to allow users to:
- View current transaction queue status
- Force process pending transactions
- Get detailed information about failed transactions

### Handling Purchase Flow

The RevenueCatService now handles purchases more robustly:

```dart
try {
  await revenueCatService.purchaseProduct(productId);
} catch (e) {
  // Purchases are now automatically queued on failure
  // so specific error handling can be simplified
}
```

## Testing

To test the robust purchase flow:
1. Enable airplane mode during a purchase
2. Observe that the transaction is queued
3. Re-enable network connectivity
4. Either wait for automatic retry or use the "Force Process Queue" option
5. Verify the purchase completes

## Implementation Details

Key classes:
- `RevenueCatService`: Handles all purchase operations with RevenueCat
- `PaymentSheetHandler`: Manages reliable payment sheet presentation
- `RobustPurchaseButton`: UI component for initiating purchases
- `PurchaseSafetySection`: Settings UI for transaction management
