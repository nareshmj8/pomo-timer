Average memory usage: 10.1295 MB
Average CPU usage: 0.641935%
UI responsiveness metrics captured

## Potential Bottlenecks

Based on the performance metrics, the following potential bottlenecks were identified:

1. **Startup Time**: If startup time is greater than 2 seconds, consider optimizing initialization.
2. **Memory Usage**: If average memory usage is above 100MB, consider memory optimizations.
3. **CPU Usage**: If average CPU usage is above 15%, investigate CPU-intensive operations.
4. **UI Responsiveness**: Check the performance overlay image for jank and dropped frames.

## Recommendations

Consider implementing the following optimizations:

1. **Lazy loading**: Defer initialization of non-essential components
2. **Image optimization**: Ensure images are properly sized and compressed
3. **Widget rebuild optimization**: Use const constructors where possible
4. **Background tasks**: Move CPU-intensive work to isolates
5. **Memory management**: Dispose controllers and listeners properly
