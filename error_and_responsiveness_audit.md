| No notification delivery verification | `lib/services/notification_service.dart:43-67` | Fixed by implementing a comprehensive notification tracking and delivery verification system that monitors notification reliability, provides statistics, and alerts users to potential delivery issues with actionable solutions |
| No database corruption handling | `lib/services/database_service.dart:117-250` | Fixed by implementing a database service with integrity verification using MD5 hashing, automatic backup/restore mechanisms, and user-facing dialogs for corruption issues with guided recovery options |
| Missing transaction rollbacks | `lib/services/database_service.dart:474-510` | Fixed by implementing a comprehensive transaction support system with retry logic for transient errors and proper error handling that ensures database operations are atomic and recoverable |
| Database service implementation | `lib/services/database_service.dart:1-629`, `lib/services/interfaces/database_service_interface.dart:1-48`, `lib/services/service_locator.dart:1-90` | Fixed by implementing a robust database service with proper interface abstraction, dependency injection, integrity checks, transaction support, backup/restore mechanisms, and comprehensive error handling |
| No data migration failure handling | `lib/services/notification/notification_service_migrator.dart:1-225` | Fixed by implementing a comprehensive migration system with version tracking, backup/restore capabilities, rollback mechanisms, and user-facing error feedback to ensure no data is lost during service migration |
| RevenueCat SDK initialization fatal error | `lib/services/revenue_cat_service.dart:274-310` | Fixed by adding proper SDK configuration checks, preventing access before configuration is complete, using Platform.isIOS instead of Theme context for platform detection, and implementing a robust error handling system to prevent crashes when RevenueCat SDK is not configured properly |
| Premium plan card content squished | `lib/widgets/premium_plan_card.dart:51-88` | Fixed by implementing responsive layout adjustments for small screens with proper spacing, font sizing, and text overflow handling |

| Landscape mode layout issues | `lib/screens/timer_screen.dart:169-207` | Fixed by improving balance between timer and controls in landscape mode with adjusted flex ratios and spacing |
| Statistics overview card sizing inconsistent | `lib/screens/statistics/components/statistics_overview.dart:1-56` | Fixed by standardizing card sizes with a grid-based layout and consistent spacing for medium screens |
| Lack of network connectivity handling | `lib/services/connectivity_service.dart:1-266`, `lib/services/interfaces/connectivity_service_interface.dart:1-47` | Fixed by implementing a centralized connectivity service that provides consistent network status monitoring, offline detection, and user feedback across the app |
| Excessive whitespace on large tablets | Medium | Various screens | Fixed by adding more aggressive font scaling and improved content density for larger screens in `lib/utils/responsive_utils.dart` |
| Font scaling not aggressive enough | Low | `lib/utils/responsive_utils.dart:48-61` | Fixed by implementing improved scaling ratios for various screen sizes with more aggressive scaling for large screens |
| Grid views not taking advantage of space | Medium | `lib/screens/history_screen.dart:124-143` | Fixed by increasing column count, optimizing spacing, and adjusting aspect ratios to improve density on larger screens |
| Insufficient contrast for some elements | Medium | `lib/widgets/premium_plan_card.dart:51-88` | Fixed by enhancing color contrast in dark mode with brighter blues, higher opacity values, and better text visibility |
| Missing global error boundary | High | `lib/notification_test_main.dart:18-26` | Fixed by implementing consistent app-wide error boundary with detailed error UI, analytics logging, and user feedback |
| Inconsistent error logging | Medium | Various locations | Fixed by standardizing error logging across all services with consistent format, severity levels, and centralized reporting |
| No crash reporting integration | High | Not implemented | Fixed by adding comprehensive error tracking and reporting system integrated with analytics service |
| Controls too spread out | Low | `lib/screens/timer_screen.dart:169-207` | Fixed by creating more compact control layout for iPads with optimized spacing and flexible layouts |
| Inconsistent shadows between modes | Low | Various components | Fixed by standardizing shadow appearance across modes with enhanced visibility in dark mode through `lib/utils/theme_constants.dart` |
| Color accessibility issues in charts | Medium | Not explicitly shown | Fixed by implementing accessible color schemes for charts with optimized contrast for both modes in `lib/utils/chart_colors.dart` |
| Button highlight states less visible in dark mode | Low | Various buttons | Fixed by enhancing visual feedback for interactions in dark mode through the new `lib/widgets/common/enhanced_button.dart` component and theme constants improvements |
