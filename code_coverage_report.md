# Pomodoro Timer App - Code Coverage Report

## Summary
- **Overall line coverage**: 0.5% (30 of 6068 lines)
- **Files with any coverage**: 64 out of 144 Dart files (44.00%)
- **Files with 0% coverage**: 49 files
- **Files not tracked by tests**: 31 files

## Key Statistics
1. Only 1 file (`app_theme.dart`) has 100% test coverage
2. The majority of the codebase (99.5% of lines) remains untested
3. Critical services like `notification_service.dart` and `revenue_cat_service.dart` have 0% coverage
4. UI components generally have minimal coverage (<2% for most screens)

## Untested Critical Components

### Services (0% coverage)
- `revenue_cat_service.dart` (533 lines) - IAP functionality
- `notification_service.dart` (186 lines) - Notifications
- `sync_service.dart` (115 lines) - Data synchronization
- `analytics_service.dart` (52 lines) - Analytics tracking

### Providers (0% coverage)
- `timer_settings_provider.dart` (345 lines) - Core app functionality
- `settings_provider.dart` (180 lines) - App configuration
- `statistics_provider.dart` (79 lines) - Statistics tracking

### Key UI Components (0% coverage)
- `premium_screen_view.dart` (222 lines) - Premium subscription UI
- `chart_card.dart` (167 lines) - Statistics visualization
- `timer_display.dart` (77 lines) - Core timer UI

## Test Challenges & Issues
1. The tests currently fail when running against the main application due to platform dependency issues:
   - Missing provider context in widget tests
   - Platform channel exceptions with notification services
   - RevenueCat service integration issues

2. Mock implementation is required for:
   - Notification services
   - In-app purchase functionality
   - Platform-dependent features

## Recommendations

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Create mocks for critical services**:
   - Create test-friendly mock implementations for RevenueCat, notifications, etc.
   - Example: `MockNotificationService` exists but needs to be used consistently

2. **Implement unit tests for core business logic**:
   - Focus on providers and services with highest line counts
   - Target `timer_settings_provider.dart` and `revenue_cat_service.dart` first

3. **Implement widget tests with TestApp**:
   - Create more widget tests using the existing `TestApp` component
   - Focus on testing widget rendering without dependencies

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Refactor for testability**:
   - Extract pure business logic from UI components
   - Improve dependency injection for easier mocking

2. **Create golden tests**:
   - Test UI appearance with golden image tests for critical screens
   - Focus on timer screen and statistics visualizations

3. **Test coverage targets**:
   - Aim for minimum 50% coverage on core functionality
   - Reach 75% coverage on business logic classes

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Continuous integration**:
   - Integrate coverage reporting into CI/CD pipeline
   - Set coverage thresholds for new code

2. **Test-driven development**:
   - Adopt TDD for new features
   - Write tests before implementing features

3. **Refactor for better separation of concerns**:
   - Separate UI from business logic more clearly
   - Extract platform-specific code to facilitate testing

## Implementation Priority
1. Core timer functionality tests (highest priority)
2. Subscription and IAP service tests
3. Data persistence and sync tests
4. Statistics calculation tests
5. UI component tests (lower priority)
