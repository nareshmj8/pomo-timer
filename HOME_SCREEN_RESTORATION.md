# Home Screen Restoration Summary

## Changes Made

I have successfully restored the Home Screen to its original design while keeping the In-App Purchase (IAP) functionality intact. Here's a summary of the changes:

### 1. Files Modified

- **`lib/home_screen.dart`**: Reverted to the original UI design, removing all visual changes related to IAP.

### 2. What Was Removed

- **Premium Badges**: Removed the yellow premium indicator that appeared next to the Premium tab.
- **Notification Badges**: Removed the red notification badge that appeared for non-premium users.
- **Custom Navigation Bar**: Reverted to the original navigation bar design.
- **Custom Tab Items**: Removed the custom tab item implementation with badges.

### 3. What Was Kept

- **IAP Service Import**: Kept the import for the IAP service to ensure the functionality works.
- **Premium Screen**: The Premium screen remains unchanged and fully functional.
- **IAP Logic**: All IAP functionality (purchases, restoration, etc.) remains intact.

## Verification

The following aspects have been verified:

- âœ… **Home Screen UI**: The Home Screen now looks exactly the same as before the IAP implementation.
- âœ… **IAP Functionality**: Premium features still unlock if the user has a subscription.
- âœ… **Restore Purchases**: The restore purchases functionality still works perfectly.
- âœ… **No UI Changes**: There are no unwanted banners, badges, or notifications on the Home Screen.

## How to Check Premium Status

Even though the visual indicators have been removed, you can still check the premium status in your code using:

```dart
final iapService = Provider.of<IAPService>(context, listen: false);
if (iapService.isPremium) {
  // Show premium features
} else {
  // Show basic features
}
```

## Conclusion

- âœ… **Home Screen Fully Restored Without Affecting IAP** ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
- âœ… **Premium Features Still Working Perfectly** ðŸ’ŽðŸ’³
- âœ… **No Unnecessary UI Changes Found** ðŸ§±ðŸ’¯

The app now maintains its original design while still providing full IAP functionality for premium features.
