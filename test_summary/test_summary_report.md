## Performance Results

Time to first frame:  ms
Average memory usage: 10.1295 MB
Average CPU usage: 0.641935%

### Performance Bottlenecks

Based on the performance metrics, the following potential bottlenecks were identified:

1. **Startup Time**: If startup time is greater than 2 seconds, consider optimizing initialization.
2. **Memory Usage**: If average memory usage is above 100MB, consider memory optimizations.
3. **CPU Usage**: If average CPU usage is above 15%, investigate CPU-intensive operations.
4. **UI Responsiveness**: Check the performance overlay image for jank and dropped frames.

## Recommendations


## Security Results

### Security Recommendations

Based on the security tests, consider implementing the following security measures:

1. **Secure Storage**: Use platform-specific secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data
2. **API Security**: Enforce HTTPS for all network connections
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper token handling and refresh mechanisms
4. **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
5. **Device Security**: Consider implementing jailbreak/root detection
6. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities


## UI/UX Issues

UI tests found. Please run UI tests and add results here.

## Final Recommendations

Based on the test results, the following recommendations are provided:

### Test Coverage Recommendations

- Maintain the current test coverage level
- Continue adding tests for new features

### Performance Recommendations

- Optimize app startup time to under 2 seconds
- Minimize memory usage, especially during background operation
- Reduce CPU usage by optimizing timer and notification logic

### Security Recommendations

Based on the security tests, consider implementing the following security measures:

1. **Secure Storage**: Use platform-specific secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data
2. **API Security**: Enforce HTTPS for all network connections
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper token handling and refresh mechanisms
4. **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest

### App Store Preparation

- Verify app icon and splash screen on all target devices
- Prepare high-quality screenshots for App Store listing
- Update app description and keywords for better discoverability
- Ensure privacy policy is compliant with App Store guidelines
- Verify in-app purchases are properly configured in App Store Connect
