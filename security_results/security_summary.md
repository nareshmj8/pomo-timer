- Dependencies have been scanned for vulnerabilities
## Secure Storage Analysis

✅ Secure storage implementation found.
The following secure storage methods were identified:

```
lib//providers/settings/theme_settings_provider.dart:import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
lib//providers/settings/timer_settings_provider.dart:import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
lib//providers/settings/history_provider.dart:import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
lib//providers/settings_provider.dart:import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
lib//test_app.dart:import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
lib//utils/theme_constants.dart:  static const List<BoxShadow> shadow = [
lib//screens/settings/testing/icloud_sync_test_helper.dart:import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
lib//screens/settings/testing/validation_checklist.md:- [ ] Verify that sensitive data is properly encrypted before syncing
lib//screens/iap_test_screen.dart:import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
lib//screens/legal/terms_conditions_screen.dart:                    'To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, or use, arising out of or in connection with these Terms or your use of the App.',
```

## API Authentication Analysis

✅ API authentication implementation found.
The following authentication methods were identified:

```
lib//screens/premium/controllers/premium_controller.dart:              e.toString().contains('authentication')) {
```

✅ No non-HTTPS URLs found in the code.

## Token Handling Analysis

⚠️ No token handling implementation found.
If the app uses token-based authentication, proper token handling should be implemented.

## Jailbreak/Root Detection Analysis

⚠️ No jailbreak/root detection implementation found.
If the app handles sensitive data, consider implementing detection for jailbroken/rooted devices.
Recommended package: flutter_jailbreak_detection

## Security Recommendations

Based on the security tests, consider implementing the following security measures:

1. **Secure Storage**: Use platform-specific secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data
2. **API Security**: Enforce HTTPS for all network connections
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper token handling and refresh mechanisms
4. **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
5. **Device Security**: Consider implementing jailbreak/root detection
6. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities
