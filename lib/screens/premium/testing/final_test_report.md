## Fixed Issues (Before & After)

### RestorePurchasesHandler Refactoring

**Before:**
```dart
// Original implementation had several issues:
// 1. No proper error handling for network failures
// 2. Loading indicators sometimes remained visible after errors
// 3. Generic error messages didn't indicate specific issues
// 4. No retry mechanism for transient errors
```

**After:**
```dart
// Enhanced implementation includes:
// 1. Robust error handling with specific error types
// 2. Automatic retry logic for network failures
// 3. Proper dialog context tracking to prevent UI leaks
// 4. Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
// 5. Clean enum-based result pattern for state management
```

### Network Error Handling Improvements

**Before:**
```dart
// Previous implementation:
// 1. Network errors caused generic "Something went wrong" messages
// 2. No automatic retry for transient network issues
// 3. Manual intervention required after network failures
// 4. Inconsistent error handling across different operations
```

**After:**
```dart
// Enhanced implementation:
// 1. Specific error messages for different network failure types
// 2. Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient errors
// 3. Graceful recovery when network is restored
// 4. Consistent error handling pattern across all operations
```

### PremiumController Integration

**Before:**
```dart
// Original implementation:
// 1. Used callback-based approach for restore purchases
// 2. No structured error handling
// 3. UI state sometimes became inconsistent after errors
```

**After:**
```dart
// Enhanced implementation:
// 1. Uses enum-based result pattern for cleaner state management
// 2. Properly updates UI state based on operation results
// 3. Handles all error scenarios gracefully
// 4. Provides clear user feedback throughout the process
```

## Edge Case Handling Improvements

### Network Interruptions

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Network Loss During Purchase | Transaction pauses, automatically resumes when network is restored |
| Timeout During Verification | Implements retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts) |
| Server Error Response | Shows specific error message with retry option |
| Offline Mode | Uses cached offerings, queues purchases for processing when online |

### User Cancellations

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| User Cancels Purchase | Gracefully returns to previous screen without error message |
| Back Navigation During Purchase | Confirms with user before cancelling transaction |
| App Backgrounded During Purchase | Maintains state, continues when app returns to foreground |

### Subscription State Changes

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Subscription Expiry | Gracefully revokes premium features with clear messaging |
| Subscription Renewal | Seamlessly extends premium access without interruption |
| Subscription Upgrade | Properly handles proration and entitlement updates |
| Subscription Downgrade | Maintains current tier until next renewal period |
