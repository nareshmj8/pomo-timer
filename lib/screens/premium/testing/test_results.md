## Implemented Fixes
1. **Improved Restore Flow Error Handling**:
   - Fixed issue with loading indicators not dismissing after network errors
   - Added more specific error messages for network issues
   - Implemented automatic retry option for network errors during restore
   - Added proper dialog context tracking to ensure dialogs are always dismissed

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Improved error detection for network issues
   - Added better logging for error scenarios
   - Implemented a more robust state management using Completer pattern

## Recommendations
1. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add a visual indicator showing network status in the premium screen
   - Implement a more prominent retry button for network failures

2. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Add more comprehensive tests for different network conditions
   - Implement automated tests for subscription renewal scenarios

## Conclusion
The RevenueCat integration is now working correctly with robust handling of offerings, entitlements, and purchase flows. The implementation shows excellent resilience to network failures and properly maintains state across app restarts.

The issues with the restore purchases flow during network failures have been fixed, ensuring that loading indicators are always dismissed and error messages are specific about network being the issue. The addition of an automatic retry option improves the user experience significantly.

Overall, the RevenueCat integration is ready for production use, with all critical functionality working correctly and providing a smooth user experience.
