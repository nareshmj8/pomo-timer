feat(revenuecat): Finalize integration with enhanced error handling, UI improvements & automated testing

This commit finalizes the RevenueCat integration with comprehensive testing, 
improved error handling, and enhanced user experience.

Key changes:
- Refactor RestorePurchasesHandler with robust error handling and retry logic
- Implement proper dialog context tracking to prevent UI leaks
- Add specific error messages for network-related failures
- Create comprehensive test suite with RevenueCatTestScreen
- Add network failure simulation for testing edge cases
- Implement enum-based result pattern for cleaner state management
- Enhance logging for better debugging and error tracking
- Update PremiumController to use new RestorePurchasesHandler API
- Document implementation changes and testing procedures

Fixed issues:
- Loading indicators sometimes remained visible after network errors
- Generic error messages didn't clearly indicate network issues
- Restore process required manual intervention after network failures
- Inconsistent error handling across different failure scenarios
- PremiumController using outdated RestorePurchasesHandler API

Testing:
- Validated offerings retrieval, purchase flow, and restore functionality
- Verified UI responsiveness and loading state management
- Tested network failure scenarios with automatic retry
- Confirmed entitlements persistence after app restart
- Measured performance metrics for API calls and UI operations

Documentation:
- Added comprehensive README with testing and debugging instructions
- Created production validation checklist
- Documented key implementation changes
- Added structured test report with performance metrics
- Created troubleshooting guide for edge cases

This completes the RevenueCat integration with production-ready
error handling, comprehensive testing infrastructure, and
detailed documentation for future maintenance.
