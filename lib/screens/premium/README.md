# RevenueCat Integration

This document provides comprehensive information about the RevenueCat integration for in-app purchases and subscriptions within the app.

## Overview

The RevenueCat integration provides the following features:

- In-app subscription management (monthly, yearly, lifetime)
- Seamless purchase flow handling with proper error management
- Restore purchases functionality with robust error handling
- Premium entitlement verification and tracking
- Subscription status tracking and management

## Key Components

- **RevenueCatService**: Core service that interfaces with the RevenueCat SDK
- **PremiumScreen**: UI for displaying subscription options and handling purchases
- **RestorePurchasesHandler**: Handles the restore purchases flow with robust error handling
- **RevenueCatTestScreen**: Dedicated screen for testing RevenueCat functionality
- **RevenueCatTestHelper**: Utilities for automated testing of RevenueCat integration

## Testing Instructions

### Running Tests Using RevenueCatTestScreen

1. **Access the Test Suite**:
   - Navigate to Settings > Developer Options > RevenueCat Test Suite
   - Or use the debug menu by shaking the device and selecting "RevenueCat Tests"

2. **Running Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Tap "Run All Tests" to execute the complete test suite
   - Tests will run sequentially and display results in the log area
   - A summary report will be shown upon completion

3. **Testing Specific Features**:
   - Use the dedicated buttons to test specific functionality:
     - "Test Offerings" - Verifies offerings retrieval
     - "Test Entitlements" - Checks entitlement verification
     - "Test Persistence" - Validates data persistence
     - "Test UI" - Verifies UI responsiveness

4. **Simulating Network Failures**:
   - Toggle "Simulate Network Failure" to test error handling
   - Select failure type (timeout, connection error, server error)
   - Run tests to verify graceful handling of network issues

### Debugging Failed Purchases & Restores

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Purchase Flow Failures**:
   - Check logs for specific error codes and messages
   - Verify RevenueCat dashboard for transaction status
   - Ensure product IDs match App Store/Play Store configuration
   - Check network connectivity and retry

2. **Restore Failures**:
   - Verify user is signed in to App Store/Play Store account
   - Check for network connectivity issues
   - Look for specific error codes in logs
   - Verify receipt validation is working correctly

#### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Logs**:
   - Check debug logs for RevenueCat API calls
   - Look for specific error codes and messages
   - Verify request/response payloads

2. **Check RevenueCat State**:
   - Use `RevenueCatTestScreen` to view current state
   - Verify customer info is loaded correctly
   - Check if offerings are retrieved successfully
   - Verify entitlements are correctly recognized

### Steps for Validating Subscription Updates

#### Testing Purchase Flow

1. **Initial Purchase**:
   - Complete purchase flow for new subscription
   - Verify entitlements are granted immediately
   - Check UI updates to reflect premium status
   - Verify analytics events are fired

2. **Renewal Testing**:
   - Use sandbox testing to simulate renewal
   - Verify entitlements continue without interruption
   - Check renewal receipt is processed correctly

3. **Cancellation Testing**:
   - Cancel subscription through App Store/Play Store
   - Verify entitlements remain until end of billing period
   - Check UI correctly reflects cancellation status

4. **Upgrade/Downgrade Testing**:
   - Test upgrading from monthly to yearly plan
   - Test downgrading from yearly to monthly
   - Verify proration is applied correctly
   - Check entitlements update appropriately

### Troubleshooting Guide for Edge Cases

#### Network Interruptions

- **During Purchase**: If network fails during purchase, the app will automatically retry when connectivity is restored
- **During Verification**: Receipt verification will retry automatically with exponential backoff
- **Persistent Failures**: After 3 retry attempts, user will be prompted to try again manually

#### App State Changes

- **Backgrounding During Purchase**: Purchase flow will continue when app returns to foreground
- **App Termination**: Incomplete transactions will be processed on next app launch
- **Device Restart**: Entitlements will be restored from RevenueCat servers on next launch

#### Account Changes

- **User Signs Out**: Premium status is tied to App Store/Play Store account
- **New Device**: Use "Restore Purchases" to recover entitlements on new device
- **Family Sharing**: Entitlements will be recognized for family members if enabled

## Implementation Notes

### RevenueCatService

The `RevenueCatService` is the core component that interfaces with the RevenueCat SDK. It handles:

- SDK initialization with proper configuration
- Offerings retrieval and caching
- Purchase processing and verification
- Customer info management
- Entitlement checking

Key methods:
- `initialize()`: Sets up the SDK with proper configuration
- `getOfferings()`: Retrieves available subscription offerings
- `purchasePackage()`: Processes purchase of a specific package
- `restorePurchases()`: Restores previous purchases
- `checkEntitlement()`: Verifies if user has specific entitlement

### RestorePurchasesHandler

The `RestorePurchasesHandler` manages the restore purchases flow with robust error handling:

- Handles network failures with automatic retry
- Provides clear user feedback during the process
- Manages UI state during restore operation
- Returns structured result using enum-based pattern

Key features:
- Automatic retry for transient network errors
- Specific error messages for different failure types
- Proper dialog context tracking to prevent UI leaks
- Clean result pattern for state management

### PremiumController

The `PremiumController` coordinates the premium features and UI:

- Manages premium state across the app
- Coordinates purchase and restore flows
- Updates UI based on subscription status
- Handles entitlement changes

Key methods:
- `checkPremiumStatus()`: Verifies current premium status
- `handlePurchase()`: Coordinates purchase flow
- `restorePurchases()`: Initiates restore process
- `onEntitlementChanged()`: Responds to entitlement changes

## Production Checklist

Before releasing to production, ensure:

1. **API Keys**:
   - Production API key is configured for release builds
   - Debug API key is only used for development/testing

2. **Product IDs**:
   - All product IDs match App Store/Play Store configuration
   - Entitlement IDs are correctly mapped

3. **Logging**:
   - Debug logs are disabled in production
   - Error logging is configured appropriately

4. **Error Handling**:
   - All error scenarios are handled gracefully
   - User-friendly error messages are displayed
   - Retry mechanisms work correctly

5. **UI/UX**:
   - Loading states display correctly
   - Success/error states are user-friendly
   - Premium features unlock immediately after purchase

6. **Final Testing**:
   - Complete purchase flow works in production environment
   - Restore purchases works correctly
   - All edge cases have been tested
